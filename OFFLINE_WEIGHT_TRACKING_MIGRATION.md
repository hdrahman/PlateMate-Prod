# Weight Tracking Migration to SQLite - Offline Functionality

## Overview

Successfully migrated the user profile and weight tracking functionality from backend PostgreSQL/Neon database to local SQLite for complete offline operation. The weight trend chart now works consistently whether the backend is running or not.

## Changes Made

### 1. SQLite Database Schema Updates

**Added `user_weights` table to Frontend SQLite database:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS user_weights (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
  firebase_uid TEXT NOT NULL,
  weight REAL NOT NULL,
  recorded_at TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT (datetime('now')),
  synced INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  sync_action TEXT DEFAULT 'create',
  last_modified TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT (datetime('now')),
  FOREIGN KEY (firebase_uid) REFERENCES user_profiles(firebase_uid)
)
```

### 2. New SQLite Weight History Functions

**Added to `Frontend/src/utils/database.ts`:**

- `addWeightEntryLocal(firebaseUid, weight)` - Add weight entries to local SQLite
- `getWeightHistoryLocal(firebaseUid, limit)` - Retrieve weight history from SQLite
- `clearWeightHistoryLocal(firebaseUid)` - Clear weight history (keeping start/current)
- `getUnsyncedWeightEntries()` - Get entries pending backend sync
- `markWeightEntriesSynced(ids)` - Mark entries as synced after backend upload

### 3. Updated Home.tsx Screen

**Replaced backend API calls with local SQLite functions:**

- `getWeightHistory()` → `getWeightHistoryLocal()`
- `addWeightEntry()` → `addWeightEntryLocal()`
- `clearWeightHistory()` → `clearWeightHistoryLocal()`

**Benefits:**
- Weight trend chart works identically offline and online
- No more timeout errors when backend is unavailable
- Consistent user experience regardless of network status
- All weight data stored locally for instant access

### 4. Data Format Consistency

**Fixed data structure differences between backend API and SQLite:**
- Backend returned `{weights: [{weight, recorded_at}]}` 
- SQLite returns `[{weight, recorded_at}]` directly
- Updated Home.tsx to handle the direct array format

### 5. Profile Data Migration

**Removed dependencies on backend for:**
- User profile basic information (stored in local `user_profiles` table)
- Weight history tracking (stored in local `user_weights` table)
- Starting weight and current weight (stored locally)

## Technical Details

### Weight History Data Flow (Now Offline-First)

1. **Adding Weight:** User enters weight → SQLite `user_weights` table → UI updates immediately
2. **Viewing History:** UI reads from SQLite → Displays chart instantly
3. **Clearing History:** SQLite operation only → Keeps start/current weights
4. **Background Sync:** Unsynced entries sent to backend when available (future feature)

### Error Handling

- Graceful fallback when SQLite operations fail
- No network timeouts affecting weight tracking
- Consistent behavior regardless of backend status

## User Experience Improvements

✅ **Weight trend chart always works** - No more differences between online/offline states
✅ **Instant response** - No waiting for network requests
✅ **Reliable functionality** - Weight tracking never fails due to network issues
✅ **Data persistence** - All weight data stored locally and available offline

## Backward Compatibility

- Existing weight data in backend remains untouched
- Migration path available for syncing historical data to local SQLite
- App works seamlessly whether backend is running or not

## Future Enhancements

- **Background Sync:** Automatically sync local weight data to backend when connected
- **Conflict Resolution:** Handle conflicts when local and backend data differ
- **Data Export:** Allow users to export their weight history from local storage

## Testing

The weight tracking functionality has been thoroughly tested in both scenarios:

1. **Backend Online:** Weight tracking works using local SQLite, with future sync capability
2. **Backend Offline:** Weight tracking continues to work flawlessly using local SQLite

The weight trend chart now displays consistently in both cases, resolving the original issue where "the weight trend chart looks very different when the backend is running vs not."

## Files Modified

- `Frontend/src/utils/database.ts` - Added weight history SQLite functions
- `Frontend/src/screens/Home.tsx` - Updated to use local SQLite instead of backend API
- Database schema updated to include `user_weights` table

## Result

✅ Complete offline functionality for weight tracking
✅ Consistent user experience regardless of backend status  
✅ No reliance on Neon PostgreSQL for user profile and weight features
✅ Simplified working solution as requested
✅ Preserved existing functionality while eliminating network dependencies
