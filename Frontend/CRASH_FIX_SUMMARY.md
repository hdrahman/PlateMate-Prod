# App Crash Fix Summary

## Issue
The app was crashing on startup due to the PersistentStepTracker trying to access the database before it was fully initialized.

## Root Cause
- BackgroundStepTracker was being initialized immediately during app startup
- PersistentStepTracker was trying to access the database before it was ready
- Database operations were failing with "Database not initialized" error

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Delayed Initialization
- Added 3-second delay before initializing persistent tracking in BackgroundStepTracker
- Added 5-second delay before enabling persistent tracking in startTracking method
- Added 2-second delay in startPersistentTrackingWithRetry method

### 2. Robust Database Readiness Check
- Improved isDatabaseReady() function to properly test database connectivity
- Added proper error handling to prevent crashes when database is not ready
- Made the function throw errors to trigger retry mechanism

### 3. Enhanced Retry Mechanism
- Increased retry attempts from 5 to 10
- Increased retry delay from 5 seconds to 10 seconds
- Added proper error propagation to trigger retries

### 4. Graceful Error Handling
- Wrapped all database operations in try-catch blocks
- Added proper logging for debugging
- Made the service continue running even if individual operations fail

### 5. Prevented Duplicate Initialization
- Added check to prevent starting persistent tracking if already running
- Added proper state management to track service status

## Files Modified
- `src/services/PersistentStepTracker.ts` - Enhanced database checks and retry logic
- `src/services/BackgroundStepTracker.ts` - Added delayed initialization and duplicate prevention

## Expected Behavior
1. App starts normally without persistent tracking
2. Database initializes completely
3. After 3 seconds, persistent tracking initialization begins
4. If database is not ready, it retries up to 10 times with 10-second intervals
5. Regular step tracking starts normally with 5-second delay for persistent service
6. Background step syncing continues even if persistent service fails to start

## Testing
Build the APK and test:
1. App should start without crashing
2. Check logs for proper initialization sequence
3. Verify that step tracking still works
4. Confirm that persistent tracking eventually starts (may take 10-60 seconds)

## Monitoring
Watch for these log messages:
- "✅ Database is ready for persistent tracking"
- "✅ Persistent step tracking service started"
- "⏳ Retrying persistent tracking start..." (if database not ready)
- "❌ Failed to start persistent tracking after maximum retries" (if all retries fail)
