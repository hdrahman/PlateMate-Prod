# PlateMate Performance Optimization

This document outlines the performance optimization strategies implemented in the PlateMate application to improve response times, reduce API calls, and enhance the overall user experience.

## Overview

We've implemented a comprehensive performance optimization strategy that focuses on:

1. **Client-side API response caching**
2. **Connection pooling in the backend**
3. **Token management and persistence**
4. **Request retry mechanisms**
5. **Preloading of common data**

These optimizations work together to provide a faster, more reliable experience for users while reducing server load and API costs.

## Key Components

### 1. Token Management (Frontend)

The `tokenManager` service provides:

- Persistent storage of API tokens in SQLite database
- Automatic token refresh before expiration
- Concurrent request handling with promise deduplication
- Token parsing and validation
- Backward compatibility with AsyncStorage

```typescript
// Example usage
import tokenManager, { ServiceTokenType } from './utils/tokenManager';

// Get a token (automatically refreshes if needed)
const token = await tokenManager.getToken(ServiceTokenType.FIREBASE_AUTH);
```

### 2. API Service with Response Caching (Frontend)

The `apiService` provides:

- LRU caching of API responses
- Automatic retry for failed requests
- Endpoint-specific cache configurations
- Cache invalidation strategies
- Background data preloading

```typescript
// Example usage
import apiService from './utils/apiService';

// Get data with caching
const recipes = await apiService.get('/recipes/random', { count: 5 });

// Force refresh
const freshData = await apiService.get('/recipes/search', { query: 'pasta' }, { forceRefresh: true });
```

### 3. Connection Pooling (Backend)

The `connection_pool` service provides:

- HTTP client pooling for external API requests
- Automatic connection lifecycle management
- Response caching with TTL
- Request retry with exponential backoff
- Graceful shutdown handling

```python
# Example usage
from services.connection_pool import get_http_client, cache_response

@cache_response(ttl_seconds=300)
async def get_data(query):
    client = await get_http_client("service_name")
    response = await client.get("/endpoint", params={"q": query})
    return response.json()
```

### 4. Backend Token Endpoints

Each service has a token endpoint that provides:

- Simulated tokens for client-side caching
- Proper authentication and authorization checks
- Consistent token format and expiration

```
POST /gpt/get-token
POST /deepseek/get-token
POST /food/get-token
POST /arli-ai/get-token
```

## Benefits

1. **Reduced API Calls**: By caching responses and tokens, we significantly reduce the number of API calls to external services.

2. **Faster Response Times**: Connection pooling and response caching lead to faster API responses.

3. **Improved Reliability**: Retry mechanisms and connection management make the app more resilient to temporary network issues.

4. **Better Offline Experience**: Persistent caching allows the app to function with limited connectivity.

5. **Reduced Server Load**: By handling more logic on the client and implementing efficient backend pooling, we reduce server resource usage.

6. **Enhanced Security**: Tokens are properly managed and stored securely, with automatic refresh before expiration.

## Implementation Notes

### Frontend

- Token management uses SQLite for persistence
- API service uses LRU caching for responses
- Preloading happens after user authentication
- All cached data is cleared on logout

### Backend

- Connection pooling uses httpx for async HTTP requests
- Response caching uses in-memory storage with TTL
- Connection maintenance runs as a background task
- Graceful shutdown ensures all connections are closed properly

## Future Improvements

1. **Offline-First Sync**: Implement a more robust offline-first approach with background sync.

2. **Cache Invalidation**: Add more sophisticated cache invalidation strategies based on data mutations.

3. **Metrics Collection**: Add performance metrics collection to monitor and optimize further.

4. **Edge Caching**: Implement edge caching for static assets and common API responses.

5. **Prefetching**: Add predictive prefetching based on user behavior patterns.
