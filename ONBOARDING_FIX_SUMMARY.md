# Onboarding Backup & Restoration Fix Summary

## Issues Found and Fixed

### üö® CRITICAL BUG #1: Weight Entry Sync Column Mismatch
**File**: `Frontend/src/utils/postgreSQLSyncService.ts:569`

**Problem**: Weight entries were being synced with wrong column name
```typescript
// BEFORE (BROKEN)
const weightData = {
    user_id: postgresUserId,  // ‚ùå Wrong column - table expects 'firebase_uid'
    weight: Number(weight.weight),
    recorded_at: String(weight.recorded_at)
};
```

**Fix**: Changed to use correct column name
```typescript
// AFTER (FIXED)
const weightData = {
    firebase_uid: firebaseUid,  // ‚úÖ Correct column name
    weight: Number(weight.weight),
    recorded_at: String(weight.recorded_at)
};
```

**Impact**: Weight entries were **failing to sync to Supabase**. Users' weight history was not being backed up.

### üö® CRITICAL BUG #2: Food Log Sync User ID Mismatch
**File**: `Frontend/src/utils/postgreSQLSyncService.ts:504`

**Problem**: Food logs were being synced with PostgreSQL UUID instead of firebase_uid
```typescript
// BEFORE (BROKEN)
const foodLogData = {
    user_id: postgresUserId,  // ‚ùå Sends UUID but should send firebase_uid string
    // ...
};
```

**Fix**: Changed to use firebase_uid
```typescript
// AFTER (FIXED)
const foodLogData = {
    user_id: firebaseUid,  // ‚úÖ Correct - firebase_uid string
    // ...
};
```

**Impact**: Food logs were **failing to sync or being associated with wrong user**. Users' food log history was not being backed up correctly.

---

### üö® CRITICAL BUG #3: No Immediate Backup After Onboarding
**File**: `Frontend/src/context/OnboardingContext.tsx:619-641`

**Problem**: After completing onboarding, user data was only saved to local SQLite. Backup to Supabase happened much later (up to 6 hours or next app background event).

**Risk**: If user uninstalled app, lost device, or app crashed before sync, **ALL onboarding data would be lost with NO backup**.

**Fix**: Added immediate sync to Supabase after onboarding completion
```typescript
// CRITICAL: Immediately backup to Supabase after onboarding completion
console.log('‚òÅÔ∏è Starting immediate backup to Supabase...');
try {
    const syncPromise = postgreSQLSyncService.syncToPostgreSQL();
    const timeoutPromise = new Promise((_, reject) =>
        setTimeout(() => reject(new Error('Sync timeout')), 30000)
    );

    const syncResult = await Promise.race([syncPromise, timeoutPromise]);

    if (syncResult.success) {
        console.log('‚úÖ Immediate backup completed successfully');
    }
} catch (backupError) {
    console.error('‚ö†Ô∏è Immediate backup failed (will retry later):', backupError);
    // Don't block onboarding - regular sync will retry
}
```

**Impact**: **New users' data is now backed up immediately** after onboarding, preventing data loss.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è MEDIUM BUG #4: Hardcoded User ID in Food Log Restoration
**File**: `Frontend/src/utils/postgreSQLSyncService.ts:1076-1096`

**Problem**: Food log restoration hardcoded `user_id: 1` and queried Supabase with wrong field
```typescript
// BEFORE (BROKEN)
const { data: rawFoodLogs } = await supabase
    .from('food_logs')
    .eq('user_id', postgresUserId)  // ‚ùå Wrong - should use firebase_uid

const foodLogData = {
    user_id: 1,  // ‚ùå Hardcoded - fragile
    // ...
};
```

**Fix**: Query by firebase_uid and get actual local user ID
```typescript
// AFTER (FIXED)
// Get local user profile to get the correct local user_id
const localProfile = await getUserProfileByFirebaseUid(firebaseUid);
const localUserId = localProfile?.id || 1; // Fallback to 1

const { data: rawFoodLogs } = await supabase
    .from('food_logs')
    .eq('user_id', firebaseUid)  // ‚úÖ Correct field

const foodLogData = {
    user_id: localUserId,  // ‚úÖ Actual local user ID
    // ...
};
```

**Impact**: Food log restoration now works correctly and is more robust.

### üßπ IMPROVEMENT #5: Temp Session Cleanup
**File**: `Frontend/src/context/OnboardingContext.tsx:413-415, 648-655`

**Problem**: Temp onboarding sessions were never cleaned up, leading to accumulated orphaned data.

**Fix**: Added cleanup in two places:
1. After successful onboarding completion
2. Periodically on app initialization (non-blocking)

```typescript
// Cleanup after completion
await cleanupOldTempOnboardingSessions();

// Periodic cleanup on init
cleanupOldTempOnboardingSessions().catch(err =>
    console.warn('‚ö†Ô∏è Failed to cleanup old temp sessions:', err)
);
```

**Impact**: Prevents accumulation of orphaned temp session data in SQLite.

## Summary

### What Was Broken:
1. ‚ùå Weight entries **NOT backing up** to Supabase (column mismatch)
2. ‚ùå Food logs **NOT backing up correctly** to Supabase (user ID mismatch)
3. ‚ùå New users' onboarding data **NOT backed up immediately** (could lose all data)
4. ‚ö†Ô∏è Food log restoration fragile (hardcoded values)
5. ‚ö†Ô∏è Temp sessions accumulating (no cleanup)

### What's Fixed:
1. ‚úÖ Weight entries now sync correctly to Supabase
2. ‚úÖ Food logs now sync correctly to Supabase
3. ‚úÖ **New users' data backed up immediately after onboarding completion**
4. ‚úÖ Food log restoration more robust
5. ‚úÖ Temp sessions cleaned up automatically

### Testing Recommendations:
1. Complete onboarding as a new user and verify immediate Supabase backup in logs
2. Add weight entries and verify they sync to Supabase
3. Add food logs and verify they sync to Supabase
4. Login on a new device and verify food logs restore correctly
5. Check Supabase tables to confirm data is being stored with correct column values
