# Step Tracking Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Background Permissions Not Requested
**Problem**: The app was not requesting background fetch permissions from the user, so background step syncing was silently failing.

**Fix**: 
- Added proper background fetch status checking in `StepCountTask.ts`
- Added user-friendly alerts when permissions are denied
- Background fetch will now show appropriate messages to users

### 2. Steps Stuck at 10
**Problem**: The pedometer implementation was incorrectly handling step counts, treating session steps as cumulative daily steps.

**Fix**:
- Fixed `startPedometerTracking()` to properly track session baselines
- Added `syncDailyStepsFromDevice()` to get actual daily step counts from the device
- Implemented proper session reset handling
- Steps now accumulate correctly throughout the day

### 3. Step Count Logic Issues
**Problem**: The step syncing logic was replacing stored counts instead of intelligently merging them.

**Fix**:
- Updated `resyncFromSensor()` to use the higher of device or stored counts
- Prevents losing steps when app restarts or goes to background
- Better handling of step count persistence

## New Features Added

### 1. Manual Step Sync
Added `manualStepSync()` method to force a step sync from the device.

### 2. Permission Alerts
Created user-friendly alerts that explain what permissions are needed and how to enable them.

### 3. Debug Utilities
Added comprehensive debugging tools:
- `debugStepTracking()` function available in development
- Comprehensive diagnostics via `diagnoseStepTracker()`
- Available as `global.debugStepTracking()` in React Native debugger

## How to Debug Step Tracking Issues

### In Development
1. Open React Native debugger console
2. Run: `global.debugStepTracking()`
3. Check the console output for detailed diagnostics

### Manual Testing
1. Open the app
2. Go to Settings > Background Services
3. Enable step tracking
4. Walk around with the app open
5. Check if steps are incrementing
6. Close the app and walk more
7. Reopen the app and check if steps synced

### Permission Troubleshooting
If steps aren't working:

#### Android
1. Go to Settings > Apps > PlateMate > Permissions
2. Enable "Physical Activity" 
3. Enable "Body Sensors"
4. Go to Settings > Apps > PlateMate > Battery
5. Ensure "Background App Refresh" is enabled
6. Disable battery optimization for PlateMate

#### iOS
1. Go to Settings > Privacy & Security > Motion & Fitness
2. Enable "Fitness Tracking"
3. Enable PlateMate in the app list
4. Go to Settings > General > Background App Refresh
5. Ensure it's enabled for PlateMate

## Code Changes Made

### Files Modified
1. `src/tasks/StepCountTask.ts` - Added background fetch permission checking
2. `src/services/BackgroundStepTracker.ts` - Fixed pedometer logic and added alerts
3. `src/utils/stepTrackingPermissions.ts` - New file with permission alerts
4. `src/utils/stepTrackingDebug.ts` - New file with debug utilities
5. `App.js` - Added debug utility import

### Key Methods Added
- `manualStepSync()` - Force sync steps from device
- `showStepTrackingPermissionAlert()` - Show permission instructions
- `showBackgroundFetchAlert()` - Show background sync limitations
- `debugStepTracking()` - Comprehensive debugging

## Testing Instructions

1. **Clear app data** to test fresh installation
2. **Enable step tracking** in settings
3. **Grant permissions** when prompted
4. **Walk 20+ steps** with app open
5. **Verify step count increases**
6. **Close app and walk more**
7. **Reopen app** and check background sync worked
8. **Use debug function** if issues persist

## Expected Behavior

- Steps should start counting immediately when tracking is enabled
- Steps should continue counting even when app is closed
- Steps should sync when app is reopened
- Users should see clear permission requests and instructions
- Background sync should work (every 15 minutes minimum)

## Notes

- Background sync frequency is controlled by the OS and may vary
- iOS requires development builds for background fetch (not available in Expo Go)
- Android battery optimization can interfere with background sync
- Steps reset at midnight each day
