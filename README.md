## Recent Updates

### Camera System Improvements (Latest)
- **Fixed camera going black randomly**: Added proper camera state management with `isCameraReady` state
- **Fixed "Failed to capture image" errors**: Implemented camera focus handling with `useFocusEffect` hook
- **Added camera initialization delays**: Cameras now wait 300ms before becoming ready to ensure proper mounting
- **Enhanced error handling**: Added `onMountError` callbacks and better ref validation
- **Improved photo capture reliability**: Added quality settings and delay before capture to ensure camera is ready
- **Applied fixes to both screens**: Camera screen and MealPlannerCamera screen now use consistent, reliable camera management

These improvements ensure the camera works consistently without going black and reliably captures photos every time.
