# Onboarding Data Saving Fix Summary

## Issue Identified
The onboarding data WAS being saved correctly to SQLite (as confirmed by logs), but the issue was with **data retrieval race conditions** and **inconsistent profile loading functions**.

## Root Causes Found
1. **Race Condition**: Account creation and onboarding completion happened too quickly, before auth state fully propagated
2. **Missing Error Handling**: No retry mechanism when user object wasn't ready
3. **Inconsistent Functions**: Mix of `getUserProfileByFirebaseUid` vs `getUserProfileBySupabaseUid`
4. **Missing Database Readiness Check**: No verification that database was ready before operations

## Fixes Applied

### 1. SubscriptionStep.tsx - Added Retry Mechanism
- Added 2-second delay after account creation to allow auth state propagation
- Implemented retry logic with 3 attempts and exponential backoff
- Better error handling and user feedback

```typescript
// Wait for auth state to fully propagate
await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 2000));

// Retry mechanism for completing onboarding
let retryCount = 0;
const maxRetries = 3;

while (retryCount < maxRetries) {
    try {
        await completeOnboarding();
        break;
    } catch (error) {
        // Retry logic with exponential backoff
    }
}
```

### 2. OnboardingContext.tsx - Enhanced completeOnboarding()
- Improved user validation with specific error messages
- Added database readiness check before operations
- Better error handling for profile creation/updates
- Enhanced logging and verification

```typescript
// Improved user validation
if (!user) {
    throw new Error('User not authenticated. Please try signing in again.');
}

// Ensure database is ready
await ensureDatabaseReady();
```

### 3. Database.ts - Fixed Profile Retrieval Consistency
- Fixed `addUserProfile()` to use `getUserProfileBySupabaseUid` consistently
- Added unified `getUserProfile()` function that works with any UID
- Added `ensureDatabaseReady()` function for better initialization checks

```typescript
// NEW: Unified profile retrieval function
export const getUserProfile = async (uid: string) => {
    // Works with both Firebase and Supabase UIDs
    // Consistent JSON parsing and boolean conversion
}
```

### 4. Profile Loading Fix - Multiple Screens
- Updated screens to use correct profile retrieval functions
- Fixed inconsistent UID usage (user.uid vs user.id)

## Testing

### Debug Script Created: `debug-onboarding-fix.js`
Run this script to verify onboarding data persistence:

```javascript
import { debugOnboardingDataFix } from './debug-onboarding-fix.js';

// Test the fix
const result = await debugOnboardingDataFix();
console.log('Fix verification:', result);
```

### What to Test
1. Complete onboarding flow with new account creation
2. Verify profile data is saved correctly
3. Check that data persists after app restart
4. Confirm goals are saved and retrievable

## Expected Results After Fix
- ✅ Onboarding data saves correctly during account creation
- ✅ Profile information persists after app restart
- ✅ Goals are saved and accessible throughout the app
- ✅ No more race condition errors during onboarding completion
- ✅ Consistent profile retrieval across all screens

## Key Improvements
1. **Eliminated Race Conditions**: Auth state now has time to propagate properly
2. **Retry Resilience**: Multiple attempts ensure success even with timing issues
3. **Better Error Handling**: Specific error messages help identify issues faster
4. **Unified Functions**: Consistent profile retrieval eliminates confusion
5. **Database Safety**: Readiness checks prevent operations on uninitialized database

The core issue wasn't data saving failure - it was timing and retrieval consistency problems that made it appear like data wasn't being saved when it actually was.
